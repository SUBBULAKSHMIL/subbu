                <h1><i>Data Structures Tutorial</i></h1>
                <p><br><br> Data Structures (DS) tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Data Structure.<br>
                    Our Data Structure tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.<br><br>

                    Data Structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.<br><br>
                    
                    Our Data Structure tutorial includes all topics of Data Structure such as Array, Pointer, Structure, <br>
                    Linked List, Stack, Queue, Graph, Searching, Sorting, Programs, etc.<br><br></p>
                <h2>What is Data Structure?</h2>
                <p>The data structure name indicates itself that organizing the data in memory. There are many ways of <br>
                    organizing the data in the memory as we have already seen one of the data structures, i.e., array in C language.<br>
                    Array is a collection of memory elements in which data is stored sequentially, i.e., one after another.<br>
                    In other words, we can say that array stores the elements in a continuous manner. This organization of data is <br>
                    done with the help of an array of data structures. There are also other ways to organize the data in memory. <br>
                    Let's see the different types of data structures.<br><br>

                    The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc. It is a set of algorithms that we can <br>
                    use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.<br><br>

                    To structure the data in memory, 'n' number of algorithms were proposed, and all these algorithms are known as<br>
                    Abstract data types. These abstract data types are the set of rules.<br><br>
                </p>
                <h2>Types of Data Structures</h2>
                <p>There are two types of data structures:<br><br>
                    <b>*Primitive data structure</b><br>
                    <b>*Non-primitive data structure</b><br>
                    <h3>Data structure</h3>
                    The primitive data structures are primitive data types. The int, char, float, double, and pointer are the primitive data structures <br>
                    that can hold a single value.<br><br>
                    Non-Primitive Data structure<br>
                    The non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:<br>
                    Linear data structure<br>
                    Non-linear data structure<br>
                    Linear Data Structure<br>
                    </p>
